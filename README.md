# Fashion MNIST

The Fashion MNIST dataset is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).

It is a dataset a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Hope you have fun!
